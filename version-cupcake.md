Reports generated by this version list up to ten sites with interactions, ranked by frequency. It's a sample, not a continuous observation, so its accuracy improves over time and new sites are sometimes a bit off.

For the federated timeline, this is just appearances on the fedline - so a huge, noisy site will naturally rank higher. It doesn't mean more local users follow that site, just that that's more likely to be what appears on the fedline.

This version has no "seed" sites, and so doesn't recommend suspensions.
