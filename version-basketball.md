Reports generated by this version list up to ten sites with interactions, ranked by frequency. It's a sample, not a continuous observation, so its accuracy improves over time and new sites are sometimes a bit off.

For the federated timeline, this is just appearances on the fedline - so a huge, noisy site will naturally rank higher. It doesn't mean more local users follow that site, just that that's more likely to be what appears on the fedline.

Emoji:

* ☢️: "Seed" site, manually tagged
* ☣️: This site interacts heavily enough with one or more seed sites to be flagged
* 🐦: BirdSiteLive (counterfeit accounts)
* ⚠️: This site has been silenced on at least one blocklist
* 🚫: This site has been suspended on at least one blocklist
* 🐘: This is a site.
 
A suspension will be recommended for sites with the first three emoji. It never recommends silencing.
